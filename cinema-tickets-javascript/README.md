# DWP Code Test - Chris Wilson ( Application ID number: 8076676 )

## Background Information

- Firstly, wasn't sure if you were allowed to use Typescript so I didn't use it. The solution would have been different as I would have coded to an interface rather an implementation.
- Secondly, there doesn't need to be a 1-to-1 ratio of adults to children ( there is a 1-to-1 ratio for adults to infants ). This implementation will therefore allow 1 adult, 19 children and 1 infant.

## How to run the service

- ```
    cd cinema-tickets-javascript
    npm install
  ```
- To run in development mode run `npm run start:dev`

## TODO

- Testing ( important!!! )
- Make the logging a little better
